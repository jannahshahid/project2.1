		Tobacco and tobacco-related products have a long history that stretches back to 6,000 BC.
		The plant today known as tobacco, or Nicotiana tabacum, is a member of the nicotiana genus – 
		a close relative to the poisonous nightshade and could previously only be found in the Americas.</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		Tobacco products gained a strong foothold in the US somewhere around the Revolutionary War. 
		War and tobacco go hand in hand as you will soon see and in 1776 it was used by the 
		revolutionaries as collateral for the loans they were getting from France.</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		1847 was the year when Philip Morris was established in the UK. They were the first to start 
		selling hand-rolled Turkish cigarettes but the practice was soon picked up by J.E. Liggett and 
		Brother, an American company established in St. Louis in 1849. Even though chewing tobacco was
		the most popular form of tobacco in the 19th century (R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was founded
		in 1875 and produced chewing tobacco, exclusively) cigarettes were slowly taking sway</div>
        <div class="grid-item">
		Cigarettes truly came into popularity after the invention of the cigarette-making machine by 
		James Bonsack in 1881. He went into business James ‘Buck’ Duke and the American Tobacco Company
		was born. The ATC survives today as a part of British American Tobacco, a global company with 
		reported revenues of 13, 104 billion in 2015.</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		In 1492, Columbus was warmly greeted by the Native American tribes he encountered when he first 
		set foot on the new continent. They brought gifts of fruit, food, spears, and more and among 
		those gifts were dried up leaves of the tobacco plant. As they were not edible and had a distinct
		smell to them, those leaves, which the Native Americans have been smoking for over 2 millennia 
		for medicinal and religious purposes, were thrown overboard.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">
		However, Columbus soon realized that dried tobacco leaves are a prized possession among the 
		natives, as they bartered with them and often bestowed them as a gift.
        Rodrigo de Jerez and Luis de Torres are the first Europeans to observe smoking.
		It was on Cuba and Jerez becomes a staunch smoker, bringing the habit back with him
		to Spain.</div>
